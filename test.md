To choose a programming language in a code block of Markdown, you can specify the language after the triple backticks (````) that start the code block. This is known as a "fenced code block" and is supported by most Markdown parsers.

 The syntax is as follows:
 ````
 ```language
 your code here
 ```
 ```

 Replace "language" with the name of the programming language you want to use. For example, if you want to specify Python, you would use:
 ```python
 print("Hello, World!")
 ```

 Some common language names that are supported include:

 * python
 * java
 * javascript
 * c
 * c++
 * ruby
 * swift
 * go
 * php
 * html
 * css

 Note that the language name is case-insensitive, so "python" and "Python" are treated the same.

 By specifying the language, you can enable syntax highlighting and other features that make your code more readable.
